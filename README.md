# Mazda3

Mazda 3 USB HUB ports got loose and would lose power/connection intermittently. It turned out that PCB with USB ports broke away from the main PCB with both some of the soldering joints broken as well as some PCB traces ripped off. This could be fixed by resoldering all the joints and adding flywires if needed for the ripped off PCB traces+
